# smallsh
This is a shell I made for a school assignment.
It does these basic things:
1. Provide a prompt for running commands
2. Handle blank lines and comments, which are lines beginning with the # character
3. Provide expansion for the variable $$
4. Execute 3 commands exit, cd, and status via code built into the shell
5. Execute other commands by creating new processes using a function from the exec family of functions
6. Support input and output redirection
7. Support running commands in foreground and background processes
8. Implement custom handlers for 2 signals, SIGINT and SIGTSTP
